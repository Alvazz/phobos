This demo performs matrix multiplication and matrix element rescaling. A 4x4
matrix is repeatedly multiplied and elements are periodically rescaled. The
matrix elements are transmitted over serial as ASCII at roughly 1 kHz.

Occasionally a transmission deadline will be missed. The program will pause
but can be resumed by pressing the microcontroller push button.
